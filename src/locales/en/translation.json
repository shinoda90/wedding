    "descr1": "It was the winter of 2018 in Hamburg, Germany‚Äîcold winds outside, but something warm was already beginning to stir. Michel and Dani were both working on Airbus projects when Dani, sitting quietly on a bus, caught sight of a sweet-faced stranger. ‚ÄúOh, that rubito is very cute,‚Äù she thought, smiling to herself. She had no idea that this simple moment would change everything.\nJust one week later, fate knocked‚Äîquite literally. On a regular workday, Dani heard someone at her office door. When she opened it, there he was: Michel. Her heart skipped a beat. She was so taken by surprise, so overwhelmed by a sudden wave of warmth, that she hugged him right then and there‚Äîcompletely forgetting that spontaneous hugs aren't exactly part of German office etiquette.\nA few days later, a Christmas market after-work event brought everyone together. The lights were glowing, laughter echoed around mulled wine, and something magical began to bloom. And just like that, a love story began.",
